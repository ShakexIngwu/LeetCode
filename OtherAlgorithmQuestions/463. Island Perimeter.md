# Solution1: Count edges

We know that for each cell that is a land and have no adjacent land, it have 4 edges and thus has a perimeter of length 4. And for any neighbor it has, the perimeter should be decreased by 2. Hence, from the top left to the bottom right, we add 4 for each land we found and deduct 2 for each of the neighbors of this cell. Note that in order to prevent any redundant deduction, we only check the upper cell and left cell of the current land. 

Suppose `m = grid.length` and `n = grid[0].length`

Time complexity: `O(m*n)`

Space complexity: `O(1)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public int islandPerimeter(int[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0 || grid[0].length == 0) return 0;
        int perimeter = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    perimeter += 4;
                    if (i > 0 && grid[i - 1][j] == 1) perimeter -= 2;
                    if (j > 0 && grid[i][j - 1] == 1) perimeter -= 2;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return perimeter;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Count land and neighbors

Following the idea of the above solution, if we know the number of lands and neighbors to the right of current land and under the current land, then the perimeter should be `4 * lands - 2 * neighbors`.  

Time complexity: `O(m * n)`

Space complexity: `O(1)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public int islandPerimeter(int[][] grid) {
        int lands = 0, neighbors = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    lands++;
                    if (i + 1 < grid.length && grid[i + 1][j] == 1) neighbors++;
                    if (j + 1 < grid[0].length && grid[i][j + 1] == 1) neighbors++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return 4 * lands - 2 * neighbors;
    }
}
```
