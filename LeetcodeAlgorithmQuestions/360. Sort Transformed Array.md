The tricky part of this question is that the graph of the function is different when a > 0 and a < 0.  
We start consider the question using 2 pointers pointing to the start and end of the nums array since they are the extremums of the functions.   
When a > 0, there are 3 conditions:  
1. the symmetry axis is within the range of nums, then 2 ends of the nums is the largest numbers.  
2. the symmetry axis is on the left of all the numbers in nums, the graph where the numbers in nums on are monotonically increasing.   
3. the symmetry axis is on the right of all the numbers in the nums, the graph where the numbers in nums on are monotonically decreasing.

In both 3 conditions we can start fill the ret array from end to beginning since we always has at least one of the end of nums having the maximum value. 

When a < 0, there are 3 conditions similar to above ones. 

When a = 0, it is always monotonically increasing or decreasing based on the value of b, but we don't have to worry it since we can deal with it like a > 0 or a < 0 while all numbers are on the same side. 

As a conclusion, there are only 2 cases: a >= 0 and a < 0.  
1. When a >= 0, the 2 sides of the array have the potential largest values, we filling the returned array from end to start, from greater values to smallers values, in a merge sort style.  
2. When a < 0, the 2 sides of the array have the potential smallest values, we filling the returned array from start to end, from smaller values to greater values, in a merge sort style. 

Thus we get following solution.

O(n) time, O(1) space where n is the length of nums array.

```Java
class Solution {
    public int[] sortTransformedArray(int[] nums, int a, int b, int c) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return new int[]{};
        int[] ret = new int[nums.length];
        int idx = a >= 0 ? nums.length - 1 : 0;
        int start = 0, end = nums.length - 1;
        while (start <= end) {
            int num1 = getVal(nums[start], a, b, c);
            int num2 = getVal(nums[end], a, b, c);
            if (a >= 0) {
                if (num1 > num2) {
                    ret[idx--] = num1;
                    start++;
                } else {
                    ret[idx--] = num2;
                    end--;
                }
            } else {
                if (num1 > num2) {
                    ret[idx++] = num2;
                    end--;
                } else {
                    ret[idx++] = num1;
                    start++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    private int getVal(int x, int a, int b, int c) {
        return a * x * x + b * x + c;
    }
}
```
