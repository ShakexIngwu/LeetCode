# Solution1: Checking for sufficient conditions

## Intuition
Let's think of `'L'` and `'R'` as people facing left and right standing in one line, and `'X'` as an empty space on that line.  

We can ask: what invariants (conditions that remain true after making any move) there are. This is natural for any question that involves transforming some state and asking whether a final state is possible.   

## Algorithm

Given that `start` and `end` are of the same length, one invariant is that `'L'` and `'R'` characters in the string can never cross each other. People walking on the line cannot pass through each other. That means the `start` and `end` strings must be the same when reading only the `'L'` and `'R'`s.  

Additionly, the `i-th` `'L'` can never go to the right of it's original position, and similarly the `i-th` `'R'` can never go to the left of it's original position. Say, if `(i1, i2, ...) and `(j1, j2, ...) are the positions of each `'L'` character in the `start` and `end` string, then we need to make sure `ik ≥ jk` for each `k` in `(1, 2, ...)`. Therewith, if `(i1, i2, ...) and `(j1, j2, ...) are the positions of each `'R'` character in the `start` and `end` string, then for each `k` in `(1, 2, ...)`, `il ≤ jk` must be satisfied.  

With this idea in mind, we can traverse the `start` array and check for the conditions.  

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of  characters in `start` and `end`  

Space complexity: `O(1)`  

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean canTransform(String start, String end) {
        if (!start.replace("X", "").equals(end.replace("X", ""))) {
            return false;
        }
        
        int l = 0, r = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < start.length(); i++) {
            if (start.charAt(i) == 'L') {
                while (end.charAt(l) != 'L') l++;
                if (i < l++) return false;
            }
            if (start.charAt(i) == 'R') {
                while (end.charAt(r) != 'R') r++;
                if (i > r++) return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Two pointers

Follow the above idea, we could make use of 2 pointers, say, `s` and `e`, pointing to current index of `start` and `end` that is not `'X'` respectively to determine if the `start` and `end` String satisfies the 2 conditions listed. 

During the traversal, we need to make sure:  
1. `start[s] == end[e]`  
2. if `start[s]` is `'L'`, it should be on the right of the corresponding `'L'` in `end`, i.e. `s > e`
3. if `start[s]` is `'R'`, it should be on the left of the corresponding `'R'` in `start`, i.e. `s < e`
4. Since there should be the same number of `'L'` and `'R'` in `start` and `end`, the 2 pointers should arrive at the end simultaneously.   

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `start` and `end`.  

Space complexity: `O(1)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean canTransform(String start, String end) {
        int len = start.length();
        int s = 0, e = 0;
        char[] sArr = start.toCharArray();
        char[] eArr = end.toCharArray();
        while (s < len && e < len) {
            while (s < len && sArr[s] == 'X') s++;
            while (e < len && eArr[e] == 'X') e++;
            // if the two string contains the same number of 'L' and 'R'
            // they must reach at the end simultaneously 
            // can be rewrite to
            // if ((s < len) ^ (e < len)) return false;
            if ((s < len) != (e < len)) return false;
            if (s < len && e < len) {
                if (sArr[s] != eArr[e] || (sArr[s] == 'L' && s < e) || (sArr[s] == 'R' && s > e)) return false;
            }
            s++;
            e++;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```
