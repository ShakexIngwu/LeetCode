# Solution1: Recursion bottom up checking

In order to prune a given node, we must make sure that there is no 1s in the subtree rooted t this node. Hence we need to perform the pruning process from leaves to root, upwards. 

For a given leave nodes, the conditions are:  
1. If this a leaf node and the value is 0, we should delete it.  
2. If this is a leaf node and the value is 1, we should keep it. 
3. For any node that we have already checked the subtree rooted at it, it can be deleted if and only if all nodes in its subtree are 0s and have been deleted. And in this case it becomes a leaf node again, so it lies in condition 1.  

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.  

Space complexity: `O(logn)` on average for the recursion stack. Worst case `O(n)`.  

```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode pruneTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        root.left = pruneTree(root.left);
        root.right = pruneTree(root.right);
        if (root.val == 0 && root.left == null && root.right == null) return null;
        return root;
    }
}
```
