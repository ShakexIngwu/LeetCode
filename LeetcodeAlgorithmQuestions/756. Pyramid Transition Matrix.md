# Solution1: DFS in the solution space

In order to construct upper levels from the bottom, we have to looking at pairs in the previous level and try to put a new block on top of it based on `allowed` to construct a valid triple. And in the process of building the pyramid level by level, once we arrived at a level that is of the length `1`, we know we have found a way to build the pyramid and should return true.  

However, for a single level, based on the `allowed` list, we can build several upper levels, of which we need to check all since we cannot know which one works a priori without building all the way up to the top level. e.g. for input `bottom = "XXYX", allowed = ["XXX", "XXY", "XYX", "XYY", "YXZ"]`, `["XXZ", "YXZ", "XYZ", "YYZ"]` are all valid upper levels we need to check.

Because of this tree-like solution space structure, we can perform a DFS in the solution space while trying to looking for the toppest level that is of length 1.  

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean pyramidTransition(String bottom, List<String> allowed) {
        Deque<String> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        deque.push(bottom);
        while (!deque.isEmpty()) {
            String curr = deque.poll();
            if (curr.length() == 1) return true;
            addLevel(deque, curr, allowed, new StringBuilder(), 0);
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    private void addLevel(Deque<String> deque, String curr, List<String> allowed, StringBuilder sb, int idx) {
        if (idx == curr.length() - 1) {
            deque.push(sb.toString());
            return;
        }
        for (String allow: allowed) {
            if (curr.indexOf(allow.substring(0, 2), idx) == idx) {
                sb.append(allow.substring(2, 3));
                addLevel(deque, curr, allowed, sb, idx + 1);
                sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
