# Solution1: DFS in the solution space

In order to construct upper levels from the bottom, we have to looking at pairs in the previous level and try to put a new block on top of it based on `allowed` to construct a valid triple. And in the process of building the pyramid level by level, once we arrived at a level that is of the length `1`, we know we have found a way to build the pyramid and should return true.  

However, for a single level, based on the `allowed` list, we can build several upper levels, of which we need to check all since we cannot know which one works a priori without building all the way up to the top level. e.g. for input `bottom = "XXYX", allowed = ["XXX", "XXY", "XYX", "XYY", "YXZ"]`, `["XXZ", "YXZ", "XYZ", "YYZ"]` are all valid upper levels we need to check.

Because of this tree-like solution space structure, we can perform a DFS in the solution space while trying to looking for the toppest level that is of length 1.  

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean pyramidTransition(String bottom, List<String> allowed) {
        Deque<String> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        deque.push(bottom);
        while (!deque.isEmpty()) {
            String curr = deque.poll();
            if (curr.length() == 1) return true;
            addLevel(deque, curr, allowed, new StringBuilder(), 0);
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    private void addLevel(Deque<String> deque, String curr, List<String> allowed, StringBuilder sb, int idx) {
        if (idx == curr.length() - 1) {
            deque.push(sb.toString());
            return;
        }
        for (String allow: allowed) {
            if (curr.indexOf(allow.substring(0, 2), idx) == idx) {
                sb.append(allow.substring(2, 3));
                addLevel(deque, curr, allowed, sb, idx + 1);
                sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Improved DFS

We could improve the performance of the above method by doing some preprocessing on the input `allowed[]` list, storing its information in a Map for quicker querying. We could either store the information of each `triple` in `allowed[]` as `map{triple.substring(0, 2): triple.charAt(2)}` or as `map{triple.charAt(0): {triple.charAt(1): triple.charAt(2)}}`. Here we use the second representation.  

Time complexity: Given the input `bottom` is of length `n` and there are a total of `a` different alphabets we might use to build the pyramid. We might try every sequence of letters for each row, the totel time complexity is `O(∑(1, n)a!) < O(∑(1, n)a^n = O(a^n)`.

Space complexity: `O(l + n + a!)` where `l` is the length of `allowed[]` and `n` is the length of `bottom` and `a` is the total number of alphabets. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean pyramidTransition(String bottom, List<String> allowed) {
        Map<Character, Map<Character, List<Character>>> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (String allow : allowed) {
            map.computeIfAbsent(allow.charAt(0), k -> new HashMap<>());
            map.get(allow.charAt(0)).computeIfAbsent(allow.charAt(1), k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(allow.charAt(2));
        }
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        return dfs(bottom, map, set);
    }
    
    private boolean dfs(String level, Map<Character, Map<Character, List<Character>>> map, Set<String> set) {
        if (level.length() == 1) return true;
        if (set.contains(level)) return false;
        set.add(level);
        List<String> uppers = new ArrayList<>();
        getUppers(level, 0, new StringBuilder(), uppers, map);
        for (String upper : uppers) {
            if (dfs(upper, map, set)) return true;
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    private void getUppers(String level, int idx, StringBuilder sb, List<String> list, Map<Character, Map<Character, List<Character>>> map) {
        if (idx == level.length() - 1) {
            list.add(sb.toString());
            return;
        }
        if (!map.containsKey(level.charAt(idx)) || !map.get(level.charAt(idx)).containsKey(level.charAt(idx + 1))) return;
        for (char c : map.get(level.charAt(idx)).get(level.charAt(idx + 1))) {
            sb.append(c);
            getUppers(level, idx + 1, sb, list, map);
            sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);
        }
    }
}
```
