# Solution1: Brute force checking

In order to get the number of good numbers, we could simply check every number from 1 to N to see if they are good number. A number is a good number if it satisfies the following condition:  
1. It contains at least 1 number from `[2, 5, 6, 9]`.   
2. It does not contain any number from `[3, 4, 7]`.  

Number `0`, `1` and `8` does not impact the result of good number as long as the number is not constructed solely by them, in which case the number will rotate to itself.  

Time complexity: `O(NlogN)`. For each number from 1 to N, we check each digit of it.  

Space complexity: `O(1)`  

```Java
class Solution {
    public int rotatedDigits(int N) {
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            if (isValid(i)) ret++;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    private boolean isValid(int num) {
        boolean valid = false;
        while (num > 0) {
            int d = num % 10;
            if (d == 3 || d == 4 || d == 7) return false;
            if (d == 2 || d == 5 || d == 6 || d == 9) valid = true;
            num = num / 10;
        }
        
        return valid;
    }
}
```
