# Solution1: Queue with sliding sum

Keep a Queue of size `size` as the sliding window to store the input numbers is intuitive. And using a queue could make the insertion `O(1)` time. However, we still need to figure out a method to get the average within `O(1)` time. Using a sliding sum is suitable for this purpose. We need to just keep a sum that recording the sum of all numbers that is within current sliding window. There are two consitions:

1. If the number of elements within current window is less than `size`, we simply add the current number into the queue.  
2. If the number of elements within current window is equal to `size`, we first `poll` the first element of the queue out and add current number into the `queue`.  

Time complexity: `O(1)` for the `next()` call.  

```Java
class MovingAverage {
    Deque<Integer> queue;
    double currSum;
    int size;

    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public MovingAverage(int size) {
        this.queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        this.size = size;
        this.currSum = 0.0;
    }
    
    public double next(int val) {
        if (queue.size() < size) {
            queue.offer(val);
            currSum += val;
        } else {
            queue.offer(val);
            currSum = currSum + val - queue.poll();
        }
        return currSum / queue.size();
    }
}

/**
 * Your MovingAverage object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MovingAverage obj = new MovingAverage(size);
 * double param_1 = obj.next(val);
 */
```
