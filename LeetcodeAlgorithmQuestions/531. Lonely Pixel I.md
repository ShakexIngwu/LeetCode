# Solution1: Storing row and column count in HashMap

We want to get the number of __Lonely Pixel__, which is the number of `'B'` in `picture[][]` that does not have any other `'B'` in its row and column.   

A na√Øve approach is to first traverse the array from upper left to lower right. During this process, for each point `(i, j)`, we check for the number of `'B'` in row `i` and column `j`. If there is no more `'B'`s found, a lonely pixel is found. The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(mn*(m+n))`.  

In order to improve the performance, we need to keep some information about the `picture[][]` we have checked. Based on the defination of lonely pixel, we can keep the number of `'B'` in each row and column in a HashMap. Afterwards, we traverse the `picture[][]` again, and for each point `(i, j)` if `rows[i] == 1` and `cols[j] == 1`, a lonely pixel is found.  

Time complexity: `O(mn)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. 

Space complexity: `O(m+n)` for the 2 HashMap.  

```Java
class Solution {
    public int findLonelyPixel(char[][] picture) {
        int ret = 0;
        if (picture == null || picture.length == 0 || picture[0] == null || picture[0].length == 0) {
            return ret;
        }
        Map<Integer, Integer> rows = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Integer, Integer> cols = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < picture.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < picture[0].length; j++) {
                if (picture[i][j] == 'B') {
                    rows.put(i, rows.getOrDefault(i, 0) + 1);
                    cols.put(j, cols.getOrDefault(j, 0) + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < picture.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < picture[0].length; j++) {
                if (picture[i][j] == 'B' && rows.get(i) == 1 && cols.get(j) == 1) {
                    ret++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```
