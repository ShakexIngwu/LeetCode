# Solution1: Count and check

This question basically contains for 2 parts:  
1. Found the count of each word.   
2. Check all the `(word, count)` pair to find the word that is not in the input `banned[]` list which has the highest count among all the words. 

So this makes it pretty straightfowward to solve it. 

We first store all the `(word, count)` pairs into a HashMap. Then we store all the words in `banned[]` into a HashSet for quick existance checking. Finally we iterate through the HashMap to find the word we want.  

Suppose there are `m` words in `paragraph` and `n` words in `banned`

Time complexity: `O(2m + n)`

Space complexity: `O(m + n)`


```Java
class Solution {
    public String mostCommonWord(String paragraph, String[] banned) {
        String[] words = paragraph.toLowerCase().split(" ");
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap();
        for (String word : words) {
            // remove any non-alphebatic characters from the word
            word = word.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z]", "");
            map.put(word, map.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (String word : banned) {
            set.add(word);
        }
        
        String ret = "";
        int max = 0;
        for (String word : map.keySet()) {
            if (!set.contains(word) && (max == 0 || map.get(word) > max)) {
                ret = word;
                max = map.get(word);
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```
