# Solution1: Comparing with lower left elelemnt

In this question we want to make sure every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same element. This can be achieved by checking every elements in the diagonal to make sure they are the same with the next one. By __next__, we mean the element to the lower right of current (say current element is `[i, j]`, next one would be `[i + 1][j + ]`.   

Meanwhile, during checking the next element in the diagonal, we have to guarantee that we are within the boundary of the `matrix[][]`.  

This led to the following solution.  

Time complexity: `O(m*n)` where `m*n` is the size of the `matrix[][]`.  

Space complexity: `O(1)`.  

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isToeplitzMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[0].length - 1; j++) {
                if (i + 1 < matrix.length && j + 1 < matrix[0].length && matrix[i][j] != matrix[i + 1][j + 1]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Cluster numbers based on diagonals

If we want to check for if the numbers belong to the same diagonal is the same, we need to find a way to cluster the numbers. Based on the observation, we found that for 2 points, `(r1, c1)`, `(r2, c2)`, in order for them to be in the same diagonal, they have to satisfies the relationship: `r1 - c1 = r2 - c2`. Hence we could use the difference between row index and column index as the key for clustering numbers in the `matrix[][]`.  

Time complexity: `O(m*n)` where `m` and `n` is the number of rows and columns respectively.  

Space complexity: `O(m + n - 1)` since this is the total number of diagonals. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean isToeplitzMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[0].length; j++) {
                if (!map.containsKey(i - j)) {
                    map.put(i - j, matrix[i][j]);
                } else {
                    if (map.get(i - j) != matrix[i][j]) return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```
