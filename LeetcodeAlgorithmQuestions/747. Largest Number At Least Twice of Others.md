# Solution1: Brute-force

First we looking for the max value among all values in `nums[]` with 1 iteration. Then we check if this `max` is at least twice as muchj as every other number in the array. 

Time complexity: `O(2n) = O(n)` where `n` is the length of `nums[]`. 

Space complexity: `O(1)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public int dominantIndex(int[] nums) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[max]) max = i;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (i != max && nums[i] * 2 > nums[max]) return -1;
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```

# Solution1: One-pass with keeping the max value

Since we want to check if the maximum value is at least twice as large as all other numbers in the array, we can compare and update the index of the max and return value on the fly. 

First of all, we keep  `max` for the index of the maximum number we have seen until now. Then each time we encounter a new number at index `i`, there are 2 conditions:  
1. `nums[i] > nums[max]`. In this case we know that `nums[max]` is now the second max number in the array and `nums[i]` is the greatest one. So we only have to check if `nums[i]` is at least twice as much as `nums[max]`.  
    1. If `nums[i]` is at least twice as much as `nums[max]`, then `max` should be `i` and return value should be `max` for now. 
    2. Otherwise, `max` should be `i`, but the return value should be `-1` for now since the current `max` does not satisfy the requirement.  
2. `nums[i] < nums[max]`. In this case we need to check if `nums[max]` satisfies the requirement.  
    1. If `nums[max]` is at least twice as much as `nums[i]`, we do nothing since this does not change any of our previous result.  
    2. Otherwise, we should change return value to `-1` since current `max` is not valid. 
    
Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `nums[]`.  

Space complexity: `O(1)`. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public int dominantIndex(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return -1;
        int max = 0;
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            //if (nums[i] > nums[max] && (nums[max] == 0 || nums[i] / nums[max] >= 2))
            if (nums[i] > nums[max] && nums[i] >= 2 * nums[max]) {
                max = i;
                ret = max;
            } else if (nums[i] > nums[max] && nums[i] < 2 * nums[max]) {
            //else if (nums[i] > nums[max] && nums[max] != 0 && nums[i] / nums[max] < 2)
                max = i;
                ret = -1;
            } else if (nums[i] <= nums[max] && nums[max] < 2 * nums[i]) {
            //else if (nums[i] <= nums[max] && nums[i] != 0 && nums[max] / nums[i] < 2)
                ret = -1;
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

# Solution3: One-pass with max and second max

The idea is to keep the maximum and second maximum value in `nums[]` and compare them at last. Since as long as the max value in `nums[]` is at least twice as much as the second maximum value in `nums[]`, it is a valid max. 

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n = nums.length`

Space complexity: `O(1)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public int dominantIndex(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return -1;
        if (nums.length == 1) return 0;
        int max = -1;
        int secMax = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (max == -1 || nums[i] > nums[max]) {
                secMax = max;
                max = i;
            } else if (secMax == -1 || nums[i] > nums[secMax]) {
                secMax = i;
            }
        }

        
        return nums[max] >= 2 * nums[secMax] ? max : -1;
    }
}
```
