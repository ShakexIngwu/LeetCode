# Solution1: Comparison characters

The solution to this question seems to be straightforward. In order to perform a quick match, we first construct a `{character: frequency}` based on the `licensePlate`. E.g. for input `"1s3PSt"`, we construct a `map = {s:2, p:1, t:1}`. 

Then for each `word` in `words[]`, we check if it __complete__ `licensePlate` based on character matching of `word` and `map`. Note that based on the question body, __complete__ here means that for each character in `licensePlate`, `word` contains at least as much this character as `licensePlate`. Then for all `word` that __complete__ `licensePlate`, we pick the shortest one and return it. 

Here we use a int variable `count` to record how many total characters we have matched. In this way we can know if we have matched all characters in `licensePlate` within `O(1)` time.  

Suppose there are `n` word in `words[]` and the words are of average length `m`. And the length of `licensePlate` is `l`. 

Time complexity: `O(l + n*(m + 26)) = O(l + n*m)` since for each `word` in `words` we need to check all of characters of a `word` to see if it __complete__ `licensePlate`, during which we have to copy the whole `map`, whose size if `θ(26)`, each time.  

Space complexity: `O(26 + m)`  

```Java
class Solution {
    public String shortestCompletingWord(String licensePlate, String[] words) {
        int[] map = new int[26];
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : licensePlate.toCharArray()) {
            if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z' || c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') {
                map[Character.toLowerCase(c) - 'a']++;
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        String ret = "";
        for (String word : words) {
            int[] newMap = new int[26];
            for (int i = 0; i < map.length; i++) {
                newMap[i] = map[i];
            }
            if (complete(word.toCharArray(), newMap, count)) {
                if (ret.equals("") || ret.length() > word.length()) {
                    ret = word;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    private boolean complete(char[] word, int[] map, int count) {
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
            if (map[word[i] - 'a'] > 0) {
                map[word[i] - 'a']--;
                count--;
            }
        }
        
        return count == 0;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Improved matching process

In the above solution, we check for absolute matching of each character in `licensePlate` with each `word` in `words`.  

However, we does not need to do so, since we only care about _for each character in `licensePlate`, `word` contains at least as much this character as `licensePlate`_, which is the meaning of __complete__ here.  As a result, we can construct a character frequency map for each `word` in `words[]` and compare the frequency of each character in it with `map` of `licensePlate` to make sure the frequency of each character in `licensePlate` appears at least as much times in `word` as `licensePlate`. 

Hence we could change the `complete()` function to the following.

Time complexity: `O(l + n*(m + 26)) = O(l + n*m)`. However this is quicker in practice since we fails early as soon as we get a `curr[i] < map[i]`. Thus the actual `complete()` function takes less than `O(m + 26)` time to complete.   

Space complexity: `O(26 + m)`.  

```Java
class Solution {
    public String shortestCompletingWord(String licensePlate, String[] words) {
        int[] map = new int[26];
        for (char c : licensePlate.toCharArray()) {
            if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'z' || c >= 'A' && c <= 'Z') {
                map[Character.toLowerCase(c) - 'a']++;
            }
        }
        
        String ret = "";
        for (String word : words) {
            if (complete(word.toCharArray(), map)) {
                if (ret.equals("") || ret.length() > word.length()) {
                    ret = word;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    private boolean complete(char[] word, int[] map) {
        int[] curr = new int[26];
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
            curr[word[i] - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (curr[i] < map[i]) return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```
