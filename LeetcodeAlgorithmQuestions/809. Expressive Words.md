# Solution1: Run length encoding

In order to compare the given string `S` and any input string `word` in `words[]`, we should at least store 2 information regarding the characters in them: 1. the relative position of all the characters; 2. the number of sequential appearance of each character. Then we could compare the characters one by one while comparing their number of appearance one by one as well. 

In order to store the above information we mentioned, we could using the so-called run length encoding of a string. Say for a string `"aabbbca"`, the run length encoding of it is `"a2b3c1a1"`.

And during the comparison, for each character in `S` and `word`, namely`c1`, `c2`, and their corresponding number of appearance `n1`, `n2`, there are 4 conditions:  

1. `c1 != c2`, this means that `word` can never be a _strechy_ of `S`.  
2. `c1 = c2`, there are 3 subconditions under this condition.  
    1. `n1 < n2`, this means there are more character in `word` than in `S`, `word` cannot be a _strechy_. 
    2. `n1 < 3`, then we must have `n1 == n2` for this character to be matched with corresponding character in `S`.  
    3. `n1 >= 3`, then can add letters to this group and make this letter extended to be the same as the corresponding group in `S`. 
    
Suppose there are `n` word in `words[]` and the average length is `k`.  

Time complexity: `O(n * k)`

Space complexity: `O(k)`  

```Java
class Solution {
    public int expressiveWords(String S, String[] words) {
        RLE R = new RLE(S);
        int ret = 0;
        
        search: for (String word : words) {
            RLE R1 = new RLE(word);
            if (!R.chars.equals(R1.chars)) continue;
            for (int i = 0; i < R.counts.size(); i++) {
                int c1 = R.counts.get(i);
                int c2 = R1.counts.get(i);
                if (c1 < c2 || (c1 <= 2 && c1 != c2)) {
                    continue search;
                }
            }
            
            ret++;
        }
        return ret;
    }
}

class RLE {
    List<Character> chars;
    List<Integer> counts;
    
    public RLE(String s) {
        chars = new ArrayList<>();
        counts = new ArrayList<>();
        int prev = -1;
        int N = s.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (i == N - 1 || s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i + 1)) {
                chars.add(s.charAt(i));
                counts.add(i - prev);
                prev = i;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
