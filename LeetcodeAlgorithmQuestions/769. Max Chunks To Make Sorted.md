# Solution1: Looking for leftmost chunk sequentially

Since the input `arr` only contains numbers in the range of `[0, arr.length - 1]`, a basic observation for this question is: for any chunk starts from index `0` and ends at index `k`, it can be a satisfactory chuck if and only if the max number in this chuck is `k`. In other words, the chunk starts in index range `[0, k]` must only contain numbers in the range `[0, k]`. Based on this foundation, we can make the induction that if the max number of a chunk within index range `[0, k+x]` is `k+x`, this could be divided into 2 chunk `[0, k]` and `[k+1, k+x]`. 

Hence we can implement the following solution. 

Time complexity: `O(n)` 

Space complexity: `O(1)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxChunksToSorted(int[] arr) {
        int ret = 0, max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            max = Math.max(max, arr[i]);
            if (max == i) ret++;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Looking for the expected number of numbers with in each chunk from left to right

Based on the above observation, we know that in order for a chuck in the index range `[i, j]` to be a satisfactory chunk, given the max number with in this range is `m`, the number of numbers in the chunk that is smaller than or equal to `m` must be `m + 1 - (i + 1)`.  

Time complexity: `O(n)`

Space complexity: `O(1)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public int maxChunksToSorted(int[] arr) {
        int prev = -1;
        int expect = 0;
        int count = 0;
        int idx = 0;
        int ret = 0;
        int found = 0;
        while (idx < arr.length) {
            if (arr[idx] > prev) {
                expect = arr[idx] + 1 - found;
                prev = arr[idx];
            }
            count++;
            if (expect == count) {
                ret++;
                found += count;
                count = 0;
            }
            idx++;
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
}
```
