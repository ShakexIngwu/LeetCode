# Solution1: Prepossing S with index mapping

Given a list of words we want to check against a input String `S` to see if they are subsequence of `S`, a brute-force method would be to check each word against `S` from start to end. However, soppose `S` has a length of `m` and the average length of words are `n`, the time complexity of brute-force method is `O(mn)`, a quadratic solution.   

How could we improve this?  

A intuitive idea is to prepossing `S`. Since we want to match for the first character of each word sequentially, we can prepossing `S` in order to keep all the index of a given character in `S`. Then for each character in a word, we looking for the index in `S` of each of its characters recursively until we've found all of them. And one thing we do need to take care of is that each time we can only looking for index in `S` after the current matching index of word's first character in `S`. In this way, we are looking for a leftmost subsequence matching for word in `S`.  

Suppose `S`'s length is `m` and there are `l` words with an average length of `n`.  

Time complexity: `O(m + n * l)`

Space complexity: `O(m)` 

```Java
class Solution {
    public int numMatchingSubseq(String S, String[] words) {
        int ret = 0;
        Map<Character, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++) {
            char curr = S.charAt(i);
            if (!map.containsKey(curr)) {
                map.put(curr, new ArrayList<>());
            }
            map.get(curr).add(i);
        }
        
        for (String word : words) {
            if (match(S, word, map, 0)) {
                ret++;
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    private boolean match(String S, String word, Map<Character, List<Integer>> map, int startIndex) {
        if (word.length() == 0) return true;
        if (!map.containsKey(word.charAt(0))) return false;
        for (int start : map.get(word.charAt(0))) {
            if (start < startIndex) continue;
            String newWord = word.substring(1, word.length());
            return match(S, newWord, map, start + 1);
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}

# Solution2：Prepossing words with next character pointer

The basic idea of this solution is prepossing each word by keeping the index of the next character that need to be match. And for all words that have the same next character, we keep them in the same bucket.  

In this way, we can do the matching with next characters of words and `S`'s current character in a BFS, or level by level, style, sequentially. See the following example:  

For input `"S = abcde" and words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]`, we first keep all words in `{a=>[(a, 0), (acd, 0), (ace, 0)], b=>[(bb, 0)]}`.   
1. After match all words with the first character in `S`, which is `'a'`, we get the following results: `{a=>[(a, 1), (acd, 1), (ace, 1)], b=>[(bb, 0)]}`. In this results, we find that the word `"a"` have been totally matched with as a subsequence, indicated by `"a".length() == nextIndex`. Thus we add `1` to the result and remove `"a"` from the list since no more matching is needed.    
2. After match all words with the second character in `S`, which is `'b'`, we get `{a=>[(acd, 1), (ace, 1)], b=>[(bb, 1)]}`.   
3. After match all words with the third character in `S`, which is `'c'`, we get `{a=>[(acd, 2), (ace, 2)], b=>[(bb, 1)]}`.  
4. After match all words with the third character in `S`, which is `'d'`, we get `{a=>[(acd, 3), (ace, 2)], b=>[(bb, 1)]}`. And again, we find a word `"acd"` has been fully matched. Hence we add `1` to result and remove this word.  
5. ... 

This gives us the following implementation.  

Suppose `S`'s length is `m` and there are `l` words with an average length of `n`.  

Time complexity: `O(m + n * l)`  

Space complexity: `O(n*l)`   

```Java
class Solution {
    public int numMatchingSubseq(String S, String[] words) {
        ArrayList<Node>[] heads = new ArrayList[26];
        for (char i = 'a'; i <= 'z'; i++) {
            heads[i - 'a'] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        
        // match each word from index 0
        for (String word : words) {
            heads[word.charAt(0) - 'a'].add(new Node(word, 0));
        }
        
        int ret = 0;
        for (char c : S.toCharArray()) {
            ArrayList<Node> waiting = new ArrayList<>(heads[c - 'a']);
            heads[c - 'a'].clear();
            for (Node n : waiting) {
                n.nextIndex++;
                if (n.nextIndex == n.word.length()) {
                    ret++;
                } else {
                    heads[n.word.charAt(n.nextIndex) - 'a'].add(n);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    class Node {
        String word;
        int nextIndex;
        Node(String word, int index) {
            this.word = word;
            this.nextIndex = index;
        }
    }
}
```
