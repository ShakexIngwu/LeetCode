# Solution1: Brute force

There seems to be no concise and efficient solution to this problem. The most straight forward solution to this question is to check each possible triangle and calculate their area. 

In order to calculate the area of a triangle in a 2D plane specificed by 3 vertex `a`, `b` and `c`, we could use the following equation: 

```
S = 1/2 * A 
```

```Java
class Solution {
    public double largestTriangleArea(int[][] points) {
        double ret = 0.0;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < points.length; j++) {
                for (int k = j + 1; k < points.length; k++) {
                    double currArea = getArea(points[i], points[j], points[k]);
                    ret = Math.max(ret, currArea);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    private double getArea(int[] a, int[] b, int[] c) {
        return 0.5 * Math.abs(a[0] * b[1] + b[0] * c[1] + c[0] * a[1] - a[1] * b[0] - b[1] * c[0] - c[1] * a[0]);
    }
}
```
