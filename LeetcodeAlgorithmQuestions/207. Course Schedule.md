# Solution1: DFS looking for cycles

In order to finish all courses, the basic constraint of the `prerequisites[]` of courses is that there must __not__ exists cycle dependencies. And that is to say, in order to finish all courses, the mutual dependence graph constructed by all of the `prerequisites[]`, or edges, of the courses must be a __Directed acyclic graph__. This is essentially the requirement of a topological sort as well. 

So in order to finish all courses, the only thing we need to do is to check for if there exists any cycles in the graph. This can be done with either BFS or DFS. 

A DFS cycle checking process is implemented as following. 

Time complexity: `O(n + e)` where `n` is the number of courses and `e` is the number of prerequisite pairs between the courses.  

Space complexity: `O(n + e)`.  

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        ArrayList[] graph = new ArrayList[numCourses];
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        }
        
        buildGraph(graph, prerequisites);
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[numCourses];
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (!dfs(graph, i, visited)) return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
    private void buildGraph(ArrayList[] graph, int[][] edges) {
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
        }
    }
    
    private boolean dfs(ArrayList[] graph, int start, boolean[] visited) {
        if (visited[start]) return false;
        visited[start] = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < graph[start].size(); i++) {
            if (!dfs(graph, (int)graph[start].get(i), visited)) return false;
        }
        visited[start] = false;
        return true;
    }
}
```
