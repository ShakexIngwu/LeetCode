# Solution1: Using a 2D array to record the count of living neighboars of each cell 

In order to update the whole board at the same time, we need to keep some information about the live cells first before we start to make any change to the board, for that any change we make will change the overall status of the board and thus impact our later change that should be made on the board. 

Hence, we use a 2D array to store the information about the live cells among the neighbors of each cell, and then we compute the next state for each cell based on the criteria listed in the question and the neighborhood live cell information stored in the 2D array. 

Suppoe the hight and width of the input `board[][]` is `m` and `n` respectively. 

Time complexity: `O(m*n)`

Space complexity: `O(m*n)`

```Java
class Solution {
    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        if (board == null || board.length == 0 || board[0] == null || board[0].length == 0) return;
        int[][] live = new int[board.length][board[0].length];
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                updateLive(board, live, i, j);
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 1 && live[i][j] < 2) board[i][j] = 0;
                if (board[i][j] == 1 && live[i][j] > 3) board[i][j] = 0;
                if (board[i][j] == 0 && live[i][j] == 3) board[i][j] = 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    private void updateLive(int[][] board, int[][] live, int i, int j) {
        for (int deltai = -1; deltai <=1; deltai++) {
            for (int deltaj = -1; deltaj <=1; deltaj++) {
                if (deltai == 0 && deltaj == 0) continue;
                int newI = deltai + i;
                int newJ = deltaj + j;
                if (newI >= 0 && newI < board.length && newJ >= 0 && newJ < board[0].length && board[newI][newJ] == 1) {
                    live[i][j]++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

# Solution2: Inplace solution storing live count of each cell

The idea is the same as the above solution. However, in order to solve the question in place, we need to remember the information of each cell in the int of the cell itself. There are 2 kinds of information we need to remember:  
1. The number of live cells in the neighborhood of a given cell.   
2. Current live/dead state of a given cell.  

In order to remember this 2 information inplace with 1 int, we use the number of live cells in neighborhood plus 1, called `liveCount` to store the count information, and use the symbol, that is, positive and negative sign, to store the current live/dead state. After storing all these information in place, we can iterate through the `board[][]` again to compute the next state.  

The reason for adding 1 to the live cell count is that we need to deal with the situation that there is no live cell around a given cell. And in this case, since we are using the sign of the cell of the board to compute the live cell in the following program (for that we have changed the number 1 or 0 with counts already, we have to check the sign of the cells already being changed). Thus if there is no live cell around a cell, the changed value would be zero and this cell will lose its original live/dead information.

Space complexity: `O(1)`

class Solution {
    /**
     * inplace solution
     */
    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        if (board == null || board.length == 0 || board[0] == null || board[0].length == 0) return;
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                updateLive(board, i, j);
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                int liveCount = Math.abs(board[i][j]) - 1;
                if (liveCount < 2 && board[i][j] > 0) {
                    board[i][j] = 0;
                } else if (liveCount > 3 && board[i][j] > 0) {
                    board[i][j] = 0;
                } else if (liveCount == 3 && board[i][j] < 0) {
                    board[i][j] = 1;
                } else {
                    board[i][j] = board[i][j] > 0 ? 1 : 0;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    private void updateLive(int[][] board, int i , int j) {
        int liveCount = 1;
        for (int deltai = -1; deltai <= 1; deltai++) {
            for (int deltaj = -1; deltaj <= 1; deltaj++) {
                if (deltai == 0 && deltaj == 0) continue;
                int newI = deltai + i;
                int newJ = deltaj + j;
                if (newI >= 0 && newI < board.length && newJ >= 0 && newJ < board[0].length && board[newI][newJ] > 0) {
                    liveCount++;
                }
            }
        }

        liveCount = board[i][j] == 1 ? liveCount : -1 * liveCount;
        board[i][j] = liveCount;
    }
}
```

# Solution3: Using bits to remember the live/dead information of a cell in current state and next state

For each int in a cell, there are 4 different states for a given cell, which are listed as following:

1. current state is live  
2. current state is dead  
3. next state is live  
4. next state is dead  

Hence we could use 2 bits of the int stored in the cell to remember this information. The representation is showed as following:  

```
[2nd bit, 1st bit] = [next state, current state]

- 00  dead (next) <- dead (current)
- 01  dead (next) <- live (current)  
- 10  live (next) <- dead (current)  
- 11  live (next) <- live (current) 
```

Note that the only transformations we need to consider is from current live to next live and current dead to next live. Since next position is default as 0 and thus is dead by default.

    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        if (board == null || board.length == 0 || board[0] == null || board[0].length == 0) return;
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                int lives = getLiveNeighbors(board, i, j);
                if (board[i][j] == 1 && (lives == 2 || lives == 3)) {
                    board[i][j] |= 0b10;
                }
                if (board[i][j] == 0 && lives == 3) {
                    board[i][j] |= 0b10;
                }
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                board[i][j] >>= 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    private int getLiveNeighbors(int[][] board, int row, int col) {
        int live = 0;
        for (int i = Math.max(0, row - 1); i <= Math.min(board.length - 1, row + 1); i++) {
            for (int j = Math.max(0, col - 1); j <= Math.min(board[0].length - 1, col + 1); j++) {
                if (i == row && j == col) continue;
                live += board[i][j] & 1;
            }
        }
        
        return live;
    }
