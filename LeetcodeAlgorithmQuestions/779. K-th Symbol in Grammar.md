# Solution1: Brute force

Simply constructing the rows sequentially and we only need to keep the last row. 

Time complexity: `O(2^N)`, since we need to parse String of length `2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(N-1)`. 

Space complexity: `O(2^N-1)`, the size of the last row. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public int kthGrammar(int N, int K) throws AssertionError {
        if (K > Math.pow(2, N - 1)) {
            throw new AssertionError("K out of range");
        }
        return getKthGrammar("0", N, K);
    }
    
    private int getKthGrammar(String curr, int N, int K) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : curr.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '0') {
                sb.append("01");
            } else { // c == '1'
                sb.append("10");
            }
        }
        if (N == 1) {
            return sb.charAt(K - 1) - '0';
        } else {
            return getKthGrammar(sb.toString(), N - 1, K);
        }
    }
}
```

# Solution2: Recursion based on parent

Above solution got TLE for larger input since it is an exponential algorithm. We want something quicker. 

Check the following rows:

```
row 1: 0
row 2: 01
row 3: 0110
row 4: 01101001
```

We found that tow consecutive given numbers in row `N`, position `K` and position `K+1` is always decided by its parent in the previous row (row `N-1`) at position `(K+1)/2`. Meanwhile, if the parent number is `0`, then the two numbers are `0` and `1` (number at odd position is `0` and number at even position is `1`). Otherwise, if the parent number if `1`, then the two numbers are `1` and `0` (nunmber at odd position is `1` and number at even position is `0`). Hence given the parent number in previous row, we have 2 possible conditions:

1. If the parent number is `0`, current number is `1-(K%2)`.  
2. If the parent number is `1`, current number is `K%2`.   

Based on the above observation, we can get a recursion algorithm to this question.  

Time complexity: `O(N)`since we need to consider `N` levels up. 

Space complexity: `O(N)` for the recursion stack. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public int kthGrammar(int N, int K) throws AssertionError {
        if (K > Math.pow(2, N - 1)) throw new AssertionError("K exceeds the range");
        if (N == 1) return 0;
        int parent = kthGrammar(N - 1, (K + 1) / 2);
        if (parent == 0) {
            return 1 - (K % 2);
        } else {
            return K % 2;
        }
    }
}
```
