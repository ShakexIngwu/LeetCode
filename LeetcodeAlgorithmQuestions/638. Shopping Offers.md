# Solution1: Recursively check every possibilities

For this question, we have the choice of either using or not using a special offer in `special` list. If we use an offer, we need to update the needs being considered for next step. Otherwise, we need to calculate the total cost without using any offer for this step.

Based on the above simple observation, we can come up with a recursion solution solving the subproblems after using a specific offer from `special`. Meanwhile, there are 2 points we need to keep in mind:   
1. We need to update the `needs` each time we used an offer.  
2. In order to use an offer, based on the question requirement, we need to make sure every item within the offer is less than or equal to the corresponding number we need specified in `needs`.  

Hence we have the following algorithm:  

1. For each step, we keep a List `res` keeping all of the possibilities in this step. The possibilities include 2 parts:   
    1. No offer is being used for this level, we simply get the number we need to pay by directly buying all items.   
    2. Every offer that can be used on the grouds of above _point 2_ is being used and the resulting cost is being recorded.   
2. If an offer is being used, we need to deduct the number of any items included in this offer from `needs` and employ the updated `needs` as the items we want for next checking.  
3. Repeat step 2 for each offer that can be used.   

Suppose there are `m` offers in `special` and we want `n` items in total.    

Time complexity:   
If we view the recursion stack as a tree, there are a total of `m+1` possibilities at each level. And the tree can be at most `n` levels in depth (if we only deduct 1 item from `needs` each time). Then the time complexity is `O((m+1)^n)` since there are this many nodes in the tree.  

Space complexity: `O(n)` for the recursion stack.  

```Java
class Solution {
    public int shoppingOffers(List<Integer> price, List<List<Integer>> special, List<Integer> needs) {
        if (needs == null || price == null) return 0;
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        // buy all needed items without special offer
        res.add(multiply(price, needs));
        
        for (int i = 0; i < special.size(); i++) {
            List<Integer> offer = special.get(i);
            if (checkNeeds(offer, needs)) {
                List<Integer> clone = new ArrayList<>(needs);
                for (int j = 0; j < clone.size(); j++) {
                    clone.set(j, clone.get(j) - offer.get(j));
                }
                res.add(offer.get(offer.size() - 1) + shoppingOffers(price, special, clone));
            }
        }
        
        int ret = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int cost : res) {
            ret = Math.min(ret, cost);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    private int multiply(List<Integer> price, List<Integer> needs) {
        int ret = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < needs.size(); i++) {
            ret += price.get(i) * needs.get(i);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    private boolean checkNeeds(List<Integer> offer, List<Integer> needs) {
        boolean ret = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < needs.size(); i++) {
            ret &= offer.get(i) <= needs.get(i);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
