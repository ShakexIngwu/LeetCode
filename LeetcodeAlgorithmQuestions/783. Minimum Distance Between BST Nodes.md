# Solution1: In order traversal

Considering that the given tree is a __Binary Search Tree__, the minimum difference between any two nodes will definitely lies in between two adjacent nodes based on in order traversal of the tree. This is because based on the definition of the Binary Search Tree, the predecessor and postdecessor of a node based on in order traversal has the closest value smaller than and greater than the current value, respectively. 

Hence we could perform a in order traversal while keeping a `prev` recording the value of predecessor we have visited, during which we keep checking the difference between prev and current value and updating the min we have found correspondingly.  

Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of tree nodes.  

Space complexity: `O(logn)` for the recursion stack.  

```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    Integer prev, ret;
    public int minDiffInBST(TreeNode root) {
        prev = null;
        ret = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        inOrderTraverse(root);
        return ret;
    }
    
    private void inOrderTraverse(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return;
        inOrderTraverse(root.left);
        if (prev != null) {
            ret = Math.min(ret, root.val - prev);
        }
        prev = root.val;
        inOrderTraverse(root.right);
    }
} 
```

# Solution2: Write all values in array

If the tree is not a __Binary Search Tree__, there is no way we can know the minimum distance a priori without first looking at a complete picture of all the values in the tree. 

Thus we could traverse the tree in any traversal methods, while storing all the values in a array. We then sort the array containing all the values and get the minimum difference between adjacent values from start to end and return it.  

Time complexity: `O(nlogn)` where `n` is the number of tree nodes.  

Space complexity: `O(n)` for the array.  

```Java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int minDiffInBST(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        dfs(root, list);
        Collections.sort(list);
        int ret = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < list.size() - 1; i++) {
            ret = Math.min(list.get(i + 1) - list.get(i), ret);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }
    
    private void dfs(TreeNode root, List<Integer> list) {
        if (root == null) return;
        list.add(root.val);
        dfs(root.left, list);
        dfs(root.right, list);
    }
}
```
