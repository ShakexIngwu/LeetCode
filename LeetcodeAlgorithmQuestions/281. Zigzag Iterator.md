# Solution1: Using 2 iterators

For this question, since we only want to iterate through 2 Lists alternatively, we need to keep separate status for each of them. In this case, we keep two iterators for List `v1` and `v2`. Once a value is being returned by `next()`, we swap the iterators to make sure next time we will call the other iterators.  

And whenever there is still elements in one of the iterators, we return `true` for `hasNext` call.  

Time complexity: `O(1)` for `next`, `O(1)` for `haxNext`.  

Space complexity: `O(1)`

```Java
public class ZigzagIterator {
    
    private Iterator<Integer> i, j, tmp;

    public ZigzagIterator(List<Integer> v1, List<Integer> v2) {
        i = v1.iterator();
        j = v2.iterator();
    }

    public int next() {
        if (i.hasNext()) {
            tmp = i;
            i = j;
            j = tmp;
        }
        return j.next();
    }

    public boolean hasNext() {
        return i.hasNext() || j.hasNext();
    }
}

/**
 * Your ZigzagIterator object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * ZigzagIterator i = new ZigzagIterator(v1, v2);
 * while (i.hasNext()) v[f()] = i.next();
 */
```

# Solution2: k-lists follow up

In this case we are dealing with `k` input Lists. For the sake of simplicity, we still make use of iterators, keeping an iterator for each of the List. And each time `next` is called, we take the front iterator out and get next element. Afterwards, we put it back to the last position.  

Time complexity: `O(1)` for next, `O(1)` for hasNext. 

Space complexity: `O(k)` given k Lists as input.

```Java
public class ZigzagIterator {
    Deque<Iterator<Integer>> iQueue;

    public ZigzagIterator(List<Integer> v1, List<Integer> v2) {
        iQueue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        if (!v1.isEmpty()) iQueue.offer(v1.iterator());
        if (!v2.isEmpty()) iQueue.offer(v2.iterator());
    }

    public int next() {
        Iterator<Integer> tmp = iQueue.poll();
        int ret = tmp.next();
        if (tmp.hasNext()) {
            iQueue.offer(tmp);
        }
        
        return ret;
    }

    public boolean hasNext() {
        return !iQueue.isEmpty();
    }
}

/**
 * Your ZigzagIterator object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * ZigzagIterator i = new ZigzagIterator(v1, v2);
 * while (i.hasNext()) v[f()] = i.next();
 */
```
