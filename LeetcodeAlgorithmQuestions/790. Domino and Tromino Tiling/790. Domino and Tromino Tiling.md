# Solution1: Dynamic programming + Divide and Conquer

Given a column with 2 rows, there are 4 different status it can be and we record them in a `dp[]` array:   
1. both are not filled, we represent this with `dp[0b00]`.  
2. both are filled, we represent this with `dp[0b11]`   
3. upper one is filled, we represent this with `dp[0b10]`   
4. lower one is filled we represent this with `dp[0b01]`  

And based on the status of the previous column, we can deduct the number of tiling ways when we add the current column based on the following criteria:   

1. The two rows in the new column is not filled, we can get it by 2 ways:   
    1. Fill one vertical domino to the 2 empty row in previous column.   
    2. Do nothing when both row in previous columns have been filled.  
2. The two rows in the new column is filled, we can get it by 3 ways:   
    1. Fill 2 herizontal domino when previous 2 rows are not filled.  
    2. Fill a tromino when there is only 1 row filled in previous column (2 cases)
3. The upper row in the new column is filled, we can get this by 2 ways:  
    1. Fill a herizontal domino to the previous condition where the lower row has been filled.  
    2. Fill a tromino to the condition where all rows in previous column is not filled.  
4. The lower row in the new column is filled, we can get this by 2 ways:  
    1. Fill a herizontal domino to the previous condition where the upper row is filled.  
    2. Fill a tromino to the condition where all rows in previous column is not filled.  
    

```Java
class Solution {
    public int numTilings(int N) {
        if (N == 0) return 0;
        int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        long[] dp = new long[]{1, 0, 0, 0};
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            long[] ndp = new long[4];
            ndp[0b00] = (dp[0b00] + dp[0b11])  % MOD;
            ndp[0b01] = (dp[0b00] + dp[0b10]) % MOD;
            ndp[0b10] = (dp[0b00] + dp[0b01]) % MOD;
            ndp[0b11] = (dp[0b00] + dp[0b01] + dp[0b10]) % MOD;
            dp = ndp;
        }
        
        return (int)dp[0];
    }
}
```
