# Solution1: DFS with memorization

In general, the serving prodecure can be constructed as a 4-nary tree. In order to know the exact probabilities of A becoming empty first, B becoming empty first and A and B becoming empty at the same time, we have to at least construct the whole tree from root to leaves. Then we can calculate the probabilities level by level. 

This brute-force construction of the Tree takes `O(4 ^ n)` time. That's too much and we need to find a way to optimize it. 

Generally, a typical way to optimize this kind of problem is to prune some branches from the tree, that is to say, we can cache the results for the subproblem we have solved. This makes up the dynamic programming solution. 

However, this solution still get `StackOverFlowError` when `N >= 660295675` due to too many recursion calls. For the method to address, please check solution2. 

Time complexity: `O(4^n)` in the worst case. 

Space complexity: `O(N / 25)` for the recursion stack. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public double soupServings(int N) {
        Map<String, double[]> map = new HashMap<>();
        // res[0] = probability of A becoming empty first
        // res[1] = probability of A and B becoming empty at the same time
        // res[2] = probability of B becoming empty first
        double[] res = dfs(N, N, map);
        return res[0] + 0.5 * res[1];
    }
    
    private double[] dfs(int A, int B, Map<String, double[]> map) {
        if (A <= 0 && B <= 0) return new double[]{0, 1, 0};
        if (A > 0 && B <= 0) return new double[]{0, 0, 1};
        if (A <= 0 && B > 0) return new double[]{1, 0, 0};
        String key = A + "#" + B;
        if (map.containsKey(key)) return map.get(key);
        double[] res_1 = dfs(A - 100, B, map);
        double[] res_2 = dfs(A - 75, B - 25, map);
        double[] res_3 = dfs(A - 50, B - 50, map);
        double[] res_4 = dfs(A - 25, B - 75, map);
        
        double[] res = new double[3];
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            res[i] = 0.25 * (res_1[i] + res_2[i] + res_3[i] + res_4[i]);
        }
        map.put(key, res);
        return res;
    }
}

# Solution2: DFS with memorization and trick

So in order to solve the above-mentioned StackOverFlowError, we have to make use of the statement in the problem: __Answers within 10^-6 of the true value will be accepted as correct.__

Since out of our 4 serving strategy, in 2 of them A serves more than B, in 1 of them A serves equal to B, and in 1 of them A serves less than B. Thus if we serve sufficient times, A will always be empty quicker than B. So that we would have the intuitive that with the increase of `N` and serving times, the probability of A becoming empty first would approach 1. Hence we could stop as soon as the probability of the answer is less than `10^-6` than 1. And the `N` value for that is around 5600. When `N = 5600`, the answer would be `0.9999990943...`. 

```Java
class Solution {
    public double soupServings(int N) {
        if (N >= 5600) return 1.0;
        Map<String, double[]> map = new HashMap<>();
        // res[0] = probability of A becoming empty first
        // res[1] = probability of A and B becoming empty at the same time
        // res[2] = probability of B becoming empty first
        double[] res = dfs(N, N, map);
        return res[0] + 0.5 * res[1];
    }
    
    private double[] dfs(int A, int B, Map<String, double[]> map) {
        if (A <= 0 && B <= 0) return new double[]{0, 1, 0};
        if (A > 0 && B <= 0) return new double[]{0, 0, 1};
        if (A <= 0 && B > 0) return new double[]{1, 0, 0};
        String key = A + "#" + B;
        if (map.containsKey(key)) return map.get(key);
        double[] res_1 = dfs(A - 100, B, map);
        double[] res_2 = dfs(A - 75, B - 25, map);
        double[] res_3 = dfs(A - 50, B - 50, map);
        double[] res_4 = dfs(A - 25, B - 75, map);
        
        double[] res = new double[3];
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            res[i] = 0.25 * (res_1[i] + res_2[i] + res_3[i] + res_4[i]);
        }
        map.put(key, res);
        return res;
    }
}
```
